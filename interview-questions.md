# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument? 

Your answer: Parameter is a variable, argument is the data that you are trying to convey and pass. 


Researched answer: In a Parameter variables are used to translate arguments into functions. An argument Function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition. Function arguments are the values passed to the function. Parameters are passed to the values of the arguments supplied.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?


Your answer: The built in method.map will take an individual data set, an array. It takes the same 3 arguements like .forEach. It was always return as a new array, of the same length as the original array. It will do something about each item in the item. A return is required when using a the .map method.

Researched answer: The .map built in method takes in 3 parameters are arguements, in one individual data set. It takes the same 3 arguements are .forEach but its reutrn a new array. [value, index, array] Index and Array are optional components in the data set.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: .map built in method with return the array to the original length of the inputted array. The .filter function is looking to minimize/simply the array by using what logic is inputted into the parameter. The .map will take logic the same as .filter but will not show the same results as .filter.

Researched answer: The .map and .filter are both built in methods that perform specificed logic to create a desired outcome/output. The difference between the two is that .map will return the original size of the parameter, and .filter will return the a new array with only displaying the results. .filter is looking to shorten the array.


4. What is iteration?

Your answer: A set of instructions that are expected to repeat until stopped.

Researched answer:  Itireation are specific set of instructions that are executed over and over until a condition is met. Arrays, strings and objects can perform iteration. An iteration needs a start, where to stop counting, and how to get from the start to the stop.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: A class are the blueprints of an object blue prints often have small spacific details and instructions on how things are suppose to be done as a whole they make up an object. A object is a data type and with in it, it has behavior. 

Researched answer: Classes are the blueprint for an object, it provides plans and specifications for an object. Classes are the brains whereas objects is the braun. A class can give attributes and properties. such as Name, Age, Gender, As for an object it would be the thing i am using my specific class for. FUN FACT: When a function belongs to an object it is called a method. Within these methods we can get more detailed on what we can call baised on the perameters of an object   

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Hoisting in javascript is when you take a collection of parameters in one javascript file, and move them to another.

Researched answer: Javascript hoisting is the process in which you can use javascript's function and behaviors prior to them being declared. It allows us to take variables and functions, no matter where they are declared, and they are moved to the top.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories:

A user story is a tool used in the Agile developemnt to capture a description of software feature from an end user persepctive. Basically verify and enable features for a good user experience. Doing things from perspective.

2. Spread operator:

A spread operator allows an iteration to expand in places where 0+ arguments are expected. It takes an array and expands it to individual elements.

3. React:
React is a Javascript library for building user interfaces. Its a single page front end code tester that tests the functionality of your code.

React is a javascript library for creating user interface. A collection of code snippers for developers to use

4. React props: React props refer to the properties of an object. When using React, a developer can create properties and values for an object by passing data into a component. Only components with data to display will use props. The use of props creates a better user experience by streamlining code that executes quickly.

Resource: Introduction to React Props & How to Use It in Your Code by Athena Ozanich https://blog.hubspot.com/website/react-props#:~:text=In%20React%2C%20the%20term%20props,and%20values%20for%20the%20object.



React props are properties being used for passing data from one component to another.



5. DOM events:
DOM events: DOM stands for Document Object Model which includes various events. Some possible events may be clicking the mouse on an HTML object or submitting a form on a webpage. For example, when a webpage is displaying a photo without any associated DOM events, the photo will remain static and cause any events. However, it the developer makes the photo enlarge by allowing the user to move the mouse pointer over the photo, a mouseover DOM has been been envoked.

DOM events are events that allow Javsscript to process event handlers on elements in an HTML document.
